The **Sustainable Energy and Environments Laboratory** aims to develop **clean, resilient, and equitable
energy systems** at the nexus of **built and natural environments** to support the well-being of humans and ecosystems.

Our research advances fundamental scientific knowledge in **thermo-fluid sciences** and **system-level design**
via **computational modeling and simulation** methods while delivering innovative energy system technologies for society. 
Our expertise includes energy system modeling (equipment to neighborhood scales), system-level **bio-inspired design** (i.e., ecosystem biomimicry), and environmental **life cycle assessment** (LCA).

Several of our modeling tools and software are **open-source** and have been integrated into major software ecosystems as part of the **U.S.
Department of Energy's next generation simulation tools** for building and community energy systems and controls, including
Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory's **[Modelica Buildings Library]** and 
the National Renewable Energy Laboratory's **[URBANopt Advanced Analytics Platform]**. 
Please see our **[papers]** and **[tools]** pages for examples across these exciting research avenues.

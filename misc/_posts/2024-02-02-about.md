# Design and Implementation

This site's source code is freely available on [GitHub](https://github.com/IDEALLab/ideallab.github.io) under the MIT license. You're welcome to borrow / repurpose code to build your own site, and if you do, I'd appreciate attribution and a link back [here](https://see-lab.github.io/about.html).

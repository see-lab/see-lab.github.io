Welcome to the **Sustainable Energy and Environments (SEE) Laboratory** at the University of Vermont! 
The SEE Lab works at the intersection of built and natural environments to design and deploy 
innovative energy system technologies that are sustainable, resilient, and equitable. 
To do this, we adopt **computational modeling and simulation** and **bio-inspired design** methods to address
**complex energy system challenges** for society. 

Some of the fundamental scientific questions we study include: 

We frequently work with **real communities** to improve their system design and operation. 
Some past applications of our research include:

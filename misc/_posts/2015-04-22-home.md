Welcome to the **Sustainable Energy and Environments (SEE) Laboratory** at the University of Vermont! 
The SEE Lab works at the intersection of built and natural environments to design and deploy 
innovative energy system technologies that are sustainable, resilient, and equitable. 
To do this, we adopt **computational modeling and simulation** and **system-level design** methods  to address
**complex energy system challenges** for society. 
Our expertise lies in **thermo-fluid** energy systems for building HVAC systems 
and controls (how can we realize better integrated systems and co-design practices?), as well as **ecosystem biomimicry** (how can anthropogenic energy systems mimic sustainable ecosystems?) and **life cycle assessment** (how can we better calculate environmental impacts of emerging energy systems?).

We frequently work with **community partners** to improve their system design and operation. 
Some past applications of our research include:
campus district heating and cooling systems; 
urban gardens of rapidly developing cities;
and culturally-centric housing with Native American communities.

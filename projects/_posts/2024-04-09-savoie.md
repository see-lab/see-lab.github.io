<div class="spacer"></div>

In collaboration with [Université Savoie Mont Blanc](https://www.univ-smb.fr/), this project aims to develop open-source models in the Modelica language to design and evaluate several multi-energy system architecutures for self-sufficient and flexible energy systems, considering stiff dynamics across key energy types (e.g., electrical and thermal systems). 
In particular, we are exploring the integration of local natural resources (e.g., lakes) for cooling and heating of buildings, including free cooling and combined heating and cooling via advanced thermal energy networks. 
With community partners, these tools are being used to evaluate system designs for a campus expansion project in France's Bourget-du-Lac District. 

**Project Period:** 09 April 2024 -- Present

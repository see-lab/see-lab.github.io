<div class="spacer"></div>

This project advances the integration of dynamic life cycle assessment (LCA) with multi-physics system modeling to better evaluate the environmental impacts of renewable energy hubs. By developing a co-simulation framework that embeds physical knowledge and accounts for energy quality and temporal variability, the research aims to improve the accuracy and accessibility of sustainability assessments for complex energy systems. The project also includes the creation of an interactive online teaching module to educate undergraduate engineers on life-cycle thinking, supporting broader goals in environmental engineering and sustainable design.

**Project Period:** 20 June 2025 -- 31 May 2027

This project takes inspiration from trophallaxis -- the way bees share food between bees -- to design bio-inspired cyber-physical systems where resources like EVs, heat pumps, batteries, and water heaters can dynamically exchange energy. By applying principles from collective insect behavior, we aim to develop new mathematical models, bio-inspired control strategies, and real-world demonstrations that can make our grids more efficient, adaptive, and resilient.


**Project Period:** 1 October 2025 -- 30 September 2028


This is a collaborative project between UVM, Penn State, CU Boulder, EVoke Systems, and PNNL.

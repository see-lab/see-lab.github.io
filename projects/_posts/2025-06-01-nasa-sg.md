<div class="spacer"></div>

In collaboration with [NASA Ames Research Center](https://www.nasa.gov/ames/), this project aims to enhance circular design strategies for space-faring systems by advancing life cycle assessment (LCA) methodologies through graph theory and geospatial analysis. By treating LCA databases as complex networks, the research uncovers hidden interconnections and resource bottlenecks in supply chains, enabling more effective designs for long-term missions beyond Earth. The project includes developing open-source tools, conducting a NASA-relevant case study, and training graduate students.

**Project Period:** 01 June 2025 -- 31 May 2026

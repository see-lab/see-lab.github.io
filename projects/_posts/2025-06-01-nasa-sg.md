<div class="spacer"></div>

In collaboration with [NASA Ames Research Center](https://www.nasa.gov/ames/), this project aims to enhance circular design strategies for space-faring systems by co-designing environmental control and life support (ECLS) systems alongside energy/power systems. This work focuses on Bioregenerative Life Support Systems (BLiSS) and applies graph theory to evaluate network-based metrics for reliability and resiliency goals. 

**Project Period:** 01 June 2025 -- 31 May 2026

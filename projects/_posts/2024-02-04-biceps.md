# Project Description

Human industrial societies today require over 70 times more energy per day than natural 
ecosystems, and all the while our societies are draining and polluting the 
invaluable life services that the natural world provides. Further, our societies are 
experiencing frequent power outages due to human threats (e.g. cyber-attacks) and natural 
disasters (e.g. wildfires, hurricanes), causing serious losses in property, economics, and 
life. The Biomimetic Integrated Community Energy and Power System (BICEPS) is a holistic 
innovative community energy system that integrates multiple renewable energy resources 
(solar electricity, hot/cold water, biofuel) to create sustainable and resilient energy 
networks. Energy resources in BICEPS are diverse, distributed, and life-friendly, mimicking 
mature natural ecosystems like a old growth forest. The BICEPS's design and operational 
schemes are tested using the cutting-edge computer modeling and simulation language Modelica, 
which is the Department of Energy's next-generation platform for building and community energy modeling.

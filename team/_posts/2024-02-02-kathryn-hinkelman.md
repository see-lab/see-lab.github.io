# Education/Background
Kathryn Hinkelman is a Postdoctoral Scholar at Pennsylvania State University (PSU). 
She has a Ph.D. in Architectural Engineering from PSU and M.S. and B.S. degrees in Mechanical Engineering 
from the University of Denver and the University of California at Berkeley. For three years, she 
worked as an industry engineer designing building energy systems for multifamily residential and 
commercial buildings across the nation. Dr. Hinkelmanâ€™s interdisciplinary research develops 
sustainable, resilient, and equitable technologies for energy systems at the nexus of built and 
natural environments to support the well-being of humans and ecosystems. Her expertise includes 
numerical modeling and simulation, system-level biomimicry, environmental life cycle assessment, 
and human-centric design thinking. She is a Phi Beta Kappa member, P.E.O. Scholar, and U.S. 
DOE IBUILD Research Fellow, and has been a major contributor to large multi-institutional projects 
funded by the NSF and DOE.

Fitz Koch is a Master's student in Complex Systems and Data Science with an interest in interdisciplinary network study, particularly industrial ecology and renewable energy. At the SEE Lab, he works to improve the dynamism of Product Life Cycle Analyses (LCA) through co-simulation with additional physical system simulation environments. He also conducts meta-analyses about the geo-spatial distribution of environmental costs within different LCA models and the biases within them.

Fitz graduated from the University of Chicago with a Bachelor's degree in English. He has worked on agricultural research stations, vegetable farms, a conservation tree nursery, as a technical writer, and as a cook. In his free time, Fitz plays and records music, reads, hosts trivia nights, and rides his bike.

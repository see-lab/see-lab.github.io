Dr. Hinkelman has been awarded an NSF Engineering Research Initiation (ERI) project titled **Towards Dynamic Life Cycle Assessment of Renewable Energy Hub Systems** through the NSF Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systems (CBET). This two-year project develops a dynamic co-simulation framework that integrates life cycle assessment (LCA) with multi-physics system modeling to more accurately evaluate the environmental impacts of renewable energy hubs. It also creates an open-source platform and interactive teaching module to support research and education in sustainable energy systems.

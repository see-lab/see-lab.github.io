Dr. Hinkelman has been awarded a VTSGC Small-Scale Research Grant on **Improving circular design methods and metrics from a life cycle perspective to support NASAâ€™s long-term space exploring systems**. In collaboration with [NASA Ames Research Center](https://www.nasa.gov/ames/), this project develops advanced graph-based methods and visualization tools to improve circular design methods and metrics for NASA life-support and environmental control systems, supporting engineering design decisions for long-term space exploration.

This research is supported by the Vermont Space Grant Consortium (VTSGC) and Vermont NASA EPSCoR Faculty Research Grant Program.

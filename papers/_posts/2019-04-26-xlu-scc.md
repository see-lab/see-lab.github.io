# Abstract 

Infrastructure in future smart and connected communities is envisioned as an aggregate of public services, 
including energy, transportation, and communication systems, all intertwined with each other. The intrinsic 
interdependency among these systems may exert underlying influence on both design and operation of the 
heterogeneous infrastructures. However, few prior studies have tapped into the interdependency among 
these systems in order to quantify their potential impacts during standard operation. In response to this, 
this paper proposes an open source, flexible, integrated modeling framework suitable for designing coupled 
energy, transportation, and communication systems and for assessing the impact of their interdependencies. 
First, a novel multi-level, multi-layer, multi-agent approach is proposed to enable flexible modeling of 
the interconnected systems. Then, for the framework's proof-of-concept, preliminary component and system-level 
models for different systems are designed and implemented using Modelica, an equation-based object-oriented 
modeling language. Finally, three case studies of gradually increasing complexity are presented (energy, 
energy + transportation, energy + transportation + communication) to evaluate the interdependencies among 
the three systems. Quantitative analyses show that the deviation of the average velocity on the road can 
be 10.5% and the deviation of the power draw from the grid can be 7% with or without considering the 
transportation and communication system at the peak commute time, indicating the presence of notable 
interdependencies. The proposed modeling framework also has the potential to be further extended for 
various modeling purposes and use cases, such as dynamic modeling and optimization, resilience analysis, 
and integrated decision making in future connected communities.

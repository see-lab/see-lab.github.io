Quantifying the energy savings of various energy efficiency measures (EEMs) for an energy retrofit 
project often necessitates an energy audit and detailed whole building energy modeling to evaluate 
the EEMs; however, this is often cost-prohibitive for small and medium buildings. In order to 
provide a defined guideline for projects with assumed common baseline characteristics, this paper 
applies a sensitivity analysis method to evaluate the impact of individual EEMs and groups these 
into packages to produce deep energy savings for a sample prototype medium office building across 
15 climate zones in the United States. We start with one baseline model for each climate zone and 
nine candidate EEMs with a range of efficiency levels for each EEM. Three energy performance 
indicators (EPIs) are defined, which are annual electricity use intensity, annual natural gas use 
intensity, and annual energy cost. Then, a Standard Regression Coefficient (SRC) sensitivity 
analysis method is applied to determine the sensitivity of each EEM with respect to the three EPIs, 
and the relative sensitivity of all EEMs are calculated to evaluate their energy impacts. For the 
selected range of efficiency levels, the results indicate that the EEMs with higher energy impacts 
(i.e., higher sensitivity) in most climate zones are high-performance windows, reduced interior 
lighting power, and reduced interior plug and process loads. However, the sensitivity of the EEMs 
also vary by climate zone and EPI; for example, improved opaque envelope insulation and efficiency 
of cooling and heating systems are found to have a high energy impact in cold and hot climates.

Ecosystem biomimicry is a promising pathway for sustainable development. However, while 
typical form- and process-level biomimicry is prevalent, system-level ecosystem biomimicry 
remains a nascent practice in numerous engineering fields. This critical review takes an 
interdisciplinary approach to synthesize trends across case studies, evaluate design methodologies, 
and identify future opportunities when applying ecosystem biomimicry to engineering practices, 
including cyber systems (CS), physical systems (PS), and cyber-physical systems (CPS). After 
systematically sourcing publications from major databases, the papers were first analyzed at a 
meta level for their bibliographic context and for statistical correlations among categorical 
variables. Then, we investigated deeper into the engineering applications and design methodologies. 
Results indicate that CPS most frequently mimic organisms and ecosystems, while CS and PS frequently 
mimic populations-communities and molecules-tissues-organ systems, respectively (statistically 
highly significant). An indirect approach is most often used for mimicry at organizational levels 
from populations to ecosystems, while a direct approach frequently suits levels from molecules 
to organisms (highly significant). Dominant themes across engineering applications include symbiotic 
organism search algorithms for CS and ecological network analysis for CPS, while PS applications are 
highly diverse. For design methodologies, this work summarizes and details ten well-documented 
biomimetic process models among literature, which addresses an outdated concern for a lack of 
systematic methods for ecosystem biomimicry. In addition to the Biomimetics Standard ISO 18458, 
these methods include the Natural Step and Techno-Ecological Synergy framework, among others. Further, 
the analyses revealed future opportunities from less utilized design methods (e.g., interdisciplinary 
teams tackling indirect, ecosystem-level projects) to well-established engineering concepts ready for 
technological advancement (e.g., implementing membrane computing for physical applications). For future 
studies, this review provides a comprehensive reference for ecosystem biomimetic design practices 
and application opportunities across multiple engineering domains.

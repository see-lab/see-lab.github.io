Prototypical building energy models are of great significance because they are the starting 
point in conducting analyses for various applications, such as building energy saving 
potential analysis, building design, building energy market evaluation, and building energy 
policy-making. However, current prototypical building energy models only represent limited 
types of buildings in certain countries. To fill the gap, this paper proposes a methodology 
to systematically create prototypical building energy models. First, a six-step methodology 
is introduced: model input identification, data collection, data cleaning, data conversion, 
model simulation, and model calibration. Then, the methodology is demonstrated by a case 
study of creating 30 prototypical energy models for U.S. religious worship buildings, 
representing buildings in 15 climate zones and 2 vintages (pre- and post-1980). Finally, 
to show the applications of the models, the building energy saving potentials from six e
fficiency measures are analyzed for pre-1980 U.S. religious worship buildings in three ASHRAE 
Climate Zones. The results show that the maximum energy saving potentials are approximately 
30% for the religious worship buildings in all three climate zones investigated, indicating 
significant opportunities for energy savings in these buildings through their prototypical 
building model development.

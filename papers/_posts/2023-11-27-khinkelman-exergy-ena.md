Although buildings are transitioning towards complex, dynamic, and interconnected systems, 
traditional engineering metrics that dominate today don't capture several important whole-network 
properties. To address this, this paper adopts ecological network analysis (ENA), which has 
numerous successes for natural ecosystems and socio-technical systems but has yet to be applied 
for buildings. After translating ENA into comprehensive mathematical models for engineering 
applications, the novel ENA method is demonstrated with building and community energy systems. 
For the models to suit building energy systems, which have multiple energy types and non-negligible 
dynamics, ENA is formulated on an exergy basis, with dynamic flows and balances (i.e., time-varying 
storages). To demonstrate the proposed approach, ENA is used to redesign the heating and cooling 
systems for an office building and data center, coupling the buildings together via ambient-loop 
district energy. The models are implemented using the equation-based Modelica language. Results 
indicate that the ENA-guided redesign reduces the source energy by 15%. The energy consumed by 
the heating and cooling systems is reduced by 84% with negligible sacrifice to the thermal performance. 
Surprisingly, the redesign also reduced the exergy efficiency of the total system from 60% to 34% 
due to a greater decrease in exergy output relative to exergy input with low-exergy system designs. 
This indicates that ENA and other network approaches that classify system organization may outperform 
traditional efficiency-based metrics for building and community energy systems when whole-system 
perspectives are desired.

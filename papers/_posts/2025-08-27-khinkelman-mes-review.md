Multi-energy systems (MES), or energy hubs, offer a technologically viable solution for maintaining resilient energy infrastructure in the face of increasingly frequent disasters, which disproportionately affect low-income and disadvantaged communities; however, their adoption for these purposes remains poorly understood. Following PRISMA 2020, this paper systematically reviews the MES literature from both resiliency and equity perspectives to identify synergies, disparities, and gaps in the context of climate change and long-term decarbonization goals. From 2420 records identified from Scopus (1997â€“2023), we included 211 original MES research publications for detailed review, with studies excluded based on their scale, scope, or technology. Risk of bias was minimized through dual-stage screening and statistical analysis across 18 physical system and research approach categories. The results found that papers including equity are statically more likely to involve fully renewable energy systems, while middle income countries tend to adopt renewable systems with biofuels more than high income countries. Sector coupling with two energy types improved the resiliency index the most (73% difference between baseline and proposed MES), suggesting two-type systems are optimal. Statistically significant differences in modeling formulations also emerged, such as equity-focused MES studies adopting deterministic design models, while resilience-focused studies favored stochastic control formulations and load-shedding objectives. While preliminary studies indicate low operational costs and high resilience can synergistically be achieved, further MES case studies are needed with low-income communities and extreme climates. Broadly, this review novelly applies structured statistical analysis for the MES domain, revealing key trends in technology adoption, modeling approaches, and equity-resilience integration.

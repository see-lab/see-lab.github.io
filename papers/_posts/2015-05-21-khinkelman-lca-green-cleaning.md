The green cleaning industry continues to pursue products that reduce or eliminate impacts on 
human health and the environment; however,these impacts over the life cycle are not well understood. 
This study assessed environmental impacts of four green cleaning products fromMethod Products, PBC 
(all-purpose cleaner, hand wash, dish soap) and Ecover (dish soap). A life cycle assessment 
from cradle-to-grave wasperformed and ReCiPe and IPCC GWP methodologies were applied. Results 
correlated greatest impact contributors to ingredient compositionand identified the need to 
improve data quality. Based on the findings, a prioritized list of actions for green cleaning 
was developed.
